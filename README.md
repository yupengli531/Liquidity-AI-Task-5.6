# Task 5.6 — Mobile Responsiveness

## Overview

This task covers the responsive design implementation and mobile testing for the LiquidityAI frontend. The goal was to ensure the application works correctly across all screen sizes — from small phones to laptops (375px, 768px, and 1024px) — with no layout breaks, usable tables, a working hamburger menu, and accessible touch targets.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `Media Mobile.css` | Main stylesheet with all responsive media queries |
| `test.html` | Test page with all 5 pages (Dashboard, Views, Graph, Pipeline, Login) for browser testing |
| `docs/responsive/` | Screenshots at each breakpoint for all major pages |

---

## What Was Done

### Req 1 — Audit all pages at 375px, 768px, 1024px

All pages were audited at three breakpoints using Chrome DevTools device toolbar. Layout breaks were identified and documented in the audit record comment block at the bottom of `Media Mobile.css`.

**Issues found and fixed:**

| Breakpoint | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 375px | `.page-content` padding too wide | Reduced to `8px` |
| 375px | `.logo-wordmark` overflows narrow topbar | Reduced to `18px` |
| 375px | `.auth-card` margin too tight | Reduced to `10px` |
| 375px | `.stat-value` too large | Reduced to `18px` |
| 480px | `.btn` padding cramps topbar | Adjusted padding |
| 768px | Grids not collapsing to single column | Set all grids to `1fr` |
| 768px | Sidebar overlay had no close transition | Switched to `opacity` transition |
| 768px | Table cells wrapping before scroll | Added `white-space: nowrap` |
| 768px | Touch targets below 44px | Added `min-height: 44px` |
| 768px | `form-input` font-size below 16px | Set to `16px` to prevent iOS zoom |
| 1024px | `.grid-3` stayed 3 columns | Collapsed to 2 columns |

### Req 2 — Media queries for each breakpoint

Four breakpoints are defined in `Media Mobile.css`:

```
1024px — Small laptop
 768px — Tablet / large phone landscape
 480px — Small phones
 375px — iPhone SE / smallest common viewport
```

All grid layouts collapse to single column at 768px and below:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-2, .grid-3, .grid-4 {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  .grid-2-1, .grid-1-2, .grid-3-1 {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

---

### Req 3 — Hamburger menu

The hamburger button is hidden on desktop and appears on mobile. The sidebar slides in from the left with a CSS transition when the hamburger is clicked.

**CSS:**
- `.hamburger-btn` has `display: none` by default
- At 768px it becomes `display: flex`
- The sidebar uses `transform: translateX(-100%)` when hidden and `translateX(0)` when open
- The overlay uses `opacity` + `pointer-events` for a smooth fade transition on close

**JavaScript (in test.html):**
- Clicking the hamburger toggles `.open` on the sidebar, button, and overlay
- Clicking the overlay closes the sidebar
- Pressing `Escape` closes the sidebar and returns focus to the hamburger button
- `aria-expanded` is updated on the button for screen readers

**HTML required in your topbar:**
```html
<button class="hamburger-btn" aria-label="Open navigation" aria-expanded="false">
  <span></span><span></span><span></span>
</button>
```

---

### Req 4 — Table responsiveness

Tables use a horizontal scroll wrapper on mobile. The `.table-wrap` div clips overflow and allows touch scrolling. The inner `.data-table` is given a `min-width` so it is always wider than the screen on mobile, forcing the scroll to activate.

```css
.table-wrap {
  overflow-x: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

.table-wrap .data-table {
  min-width: 480px;
  width: max-content;
}
```

Tested with 8-column tables on Dashboard and Views pages — confirmed scrollable at 375px.

---

### Req 5 — Screenshots

Screenshots at all 3 breakpoints for all 5 major pages are saved in `docs/responsive/`.

| Page | 375px | 768px | 1024px |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Views | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Graph | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pipeline | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Login | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

### Req 6 — Touch interactions

All interactive elements meet the 44×44px minimum touch target size on mobile.

| Element | Desktop | Mobile (≥768px) |
|---|---|---|
| `.btn` | 30px | `min-height: 44px` |
| `.icon-btn` | 32×32px | 44×44px |
| `.nav-item` | 36px | `padding: 12px 10px` |
| `.form-input` | 36px | `padding: 12px`, `font-size: 16px` |
| `.toggle` | 20px | 44×44px wrapper |
| `.hamburger-btn` | hidden | 44×44px |

`font-size: 16px` on inputs prevents iOS Safari from auto-zooming when a user taps an input field.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criteria | Status |
|---|---|
| No horizontal overflow at 375px, 768px, 1024px | ✅ |
| Hamburger menu works smoothly with focus management | ✅ |
| Tables are usable on mobile (horizontal scroll) | ✅ |
| All touch targets are at least 44×44px | ✅ |
| Screenshots at all 3 breakpoints for 5 pages | ✅ |

## How to Test

1. Clone the repo and open in VS Code
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (by Ritwick Dey)
3. Right-click `test.html` → **Open with Live Server**
4. Open Chrome DevTools (`F12`) → Toggle Device Toolbar (`Ctrl + Shift + M`)
5. Test at widths: `375`, `768`, `1024`

**Overflow check (run in DevTools Console):**
```js
document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {
  if (el.scrollWidth > document.body.offsetWidth) console.log(el);
});
```

**Touch target check (run in DevTools Console):**
```js
const btn = document.querySelector('.btn-primary');
const styles = window.getComputedStyle(btn);
console.log('min-height:', styles.minHeight);
```

## Notes

- `test.html` is a prototype for testing the CSS only — it does not connect to the database or backend
- The Graph page shows a placeholder canvas — the actual graph visualisation (D3.js / vis.js) will be implemented in a later task
- Tab navigation within pages (e.g. All Views / Shared / Mine) is CSS-only styling — click handlers will be wired up when the frontend framework is integrated
